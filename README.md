## Image Album Instructions

To create an image album, you can organize your images in a dedicated folder and reference them in your README file.

1. **Organize Images**: Place all your images in a folder, for example, `images/album`.
2. **Reference Images**: Use the following Markdown syntax to display the images:
   ```markdown
   ![Alt text](images/album/image1.jpg)
   ![Alt text](images/album/image2.jpg)
   ```

### Example
Hereâ€™s how you can display images in your README:
```markdown
![Image 1](images/album/image1.jpg)
![Image 2](images/album/image2.jpg)
![Image 3](images/album/image3.jpg)
![Image 4](images/album/image4.jpg)
![Image 5](images/album/image5.jpg)
![Image 6](images/album/image6.jpg)
![Image 7](images/album/image7.jpg)
